#### For this hackathon we created a web application to judge your happiness when reading a news article.  
#### If you liked the article, you'll be given an opportunity to send the article in an email to your top email contacts.
#### We used Flask, Python, Microsoft's Graphi API and Microsoft's Emotion API to accomplish this task.
#### Are you ready to feed the tigers?
